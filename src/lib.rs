//! Playstation Controller driver for Rust's [Embedded Hardware Abstraction Layer](https://github.com/japaric/embedded-hal)
//! ============================
//! 
//! The original PlayStation and most of its peripherals are 20+ years old at this point,
//! but they're easy to interface with for fun projects, and wireless variants are easy
//! to come by while being [pretty cheap](https://www.amazon.ca/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=ps2+wireless+controller)
//! ($28 Canadian for two as of this writing).
//! 
//! The current state of this library is such that it's fairly na√Øve to which controller
//! is plugged in, and will make a guess based on the device type (1 - 15) and
//! how many 16bit words are being returned. For those who know the protocol, this library
//! reads the second byte from the poll command and wraps the response in a struct based
//! on that so it's lightweight on memory
//! 
//! Efficiencies can be made here, and things will likely improve, but the darn thing is
//! useful now so let's start using it! If you find things to fix, please make an issue.
//! 
//! Hardware
//! -----------------------
//! 
//! Because the PlayStation could have up to four devices sharing the same SPI bus (two
//! controllers and two memory cards), they made the data out (MISO) pin open drain so you'll
//! need to add your own resistor. In my testing with a voltage divider on a PlayStation 2,
//! the value is around 220 - 500 ohms. I'm not sure if the controller jack assembly
//! contains one of these yet, so you should double check with a multimeter before plugging
//! anything in.
